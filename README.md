# FoursquareVenues

A sample one page app that gets nearby locations from FourSquare REST API based on the keyword entered by the user.

The app doesn't have Foursquare keys, so in order to make it compile please add a `secrets.properties` file to the root of the project and adds the keys there.
It should looks something like this:

```
FOURSQUARE_CLIENT_ID = XXXXXXXX
FOURSQUARE_CLIENT_SECRET = XXXXXXXX
```
